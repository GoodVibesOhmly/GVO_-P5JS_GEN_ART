## Ferris Wheel

*Building Blocks*

This is a very basic script, mainly to illustrate the power of `rotate` instead of worrying about
r * sin(theta) and r*cos(theta) calculations.

## Code

There are five very simple scripts, intended for beginners and learners who are new to Processing.py.
Go through them in order, and you will see how each step builds on the previous.

    01_wheel_static.py
    02_two_circles_revolving_around_a_point.py  
    03_twelve_static_circles_using_rotate.py       
    04_twelve_circles_revolving_around_a_point.py
    05_ferris.wheel.py
