# Ball Animations

`ball.py` has the Class, with move and display logic.

## Balls_Crossing.py

There are a series of balls that travel horizontally, and another set that travels vertically.
Can they criss-cross without ever bumping into each other? That's what this this animation attempts to do.
(Inspired by a marching band pattern that I saw decades ago.)

You can play around with many of the parameters in the code:
`num_set` is the number of balls in each set
