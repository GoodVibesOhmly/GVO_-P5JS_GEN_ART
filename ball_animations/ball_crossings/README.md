## The Basic Idea

Go through [01_ball_crossing_baiscs.py](01_ball_crossing_basics.py) to see the core idea.
One set of balls moves horizontally, another moves vertically. Timing is controlled by Speed, number of balls,
the canvas dimensions, all of which gives the optimal separation such that all collisions are avoided.
