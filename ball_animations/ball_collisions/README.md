# Ball Collisions

<img src = "images/ball_collisions.gif" widht="500">

Idea: Inside a box, there are a number of balls moving around. These balls sometimes collide
against each other. And whenever they do, they both change color. The colors are in a preset
cycle, so the balls are endless changing.

Future Work to be implemented: This happens against a checkered background. But when a ball goes too close to a square's center, it swaps its color with the square. 

### Code

There is a Python Class called Ball, which is used to control all of the Ball properties. So be sure
to keep ball.py in the same folder as the code. Also, as the code evolved, older versions of ball.py are
included here, so that the learner can see how each step build on the previous.
