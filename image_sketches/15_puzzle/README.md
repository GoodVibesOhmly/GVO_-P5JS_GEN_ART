# Tutorial: Coding the 15-Puzzle Using Processing

## A Step by Step Apprpach

Main concept: Code a simple "puzzle" using Processing.py

The [15-tiles sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) is fairly well-known.
For those wishing to learn Processing, here's one implementation of it.

## The Challenge At Hand

Take a Base Image. Chop it up into 16 smaller "postage stamp" images.
Move them around when the "hole" is clicked on.

## Step by Step Approach

Since I created this for a tutorial, I saved actual versions of my code so that anyone viewing can follow
my thought process along.

If you just want the final implementation, run `11_complete_puzzle_with_flourishes.py`
