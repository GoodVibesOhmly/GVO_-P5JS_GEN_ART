### Processing Repos
Here a few Processing-based GenArt repos that I like, admire and am inspired by.

- https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming
- https://github.com/nmillward/processing_sketches


### Python Repos
Here are a few Python-based GenArt repos that I like, admire, and am inspired by.

- https://github.com/anaulin/generative-art
- https://github.com/aaronpenne/generative_art
- https://github.com/gengeomergence/GenArt
- https://github.com/houseofleft/generative_python_scripts

## P5.js
- Generative Design - Companion site to the Book, with working code on every piece of the gallery (http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/)


## Video Tutorials (YouTube)

- Eric Davidson: - https://github.com/erdavids?tab=repositories
I really like [Eric's videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBuffED/videos). He is an excellent (and generous) teacher. I first came across his Mondrain Tiles project.
- Niraj Rajan has several quick and easy examples to try: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbU3H-1ix4dQK8KVl6391jmXJTULDY_-c

- **Matthew Epler** [has an excellent playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTqvf0BkTNE&list=PLyRZnpOSgMj3K8AV2I6UldnvTj6d_Zrf0) (series of short videos) on how he looks at one image and goes about creating an entire "Generative System" around it. He does it very organically, starting with simpler steps and is constantly layering in complexity. Well worth watching, *even if you are not coding in P5.js!* [Code](https://github.com/matthewepler/Generative-Design-Systems-with-P5js)

### Books

 -1. [The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman](https://natureofcode.com/) - The "Bible" of GenArt. The book is available for free to browse online. All the code is downloadable. Plus [Daniel's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) is a priceless resource for those seeking to learn.

 -2. [Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Generative-Design-Visualize-Program-Processing/dp/1616890770/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=generative+design&qid=1596110874&sr=8-2) Authors: Hartmut Bohnacker, Benedikt Gross, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni (Editor)

- 3. [Airtable's List of over 150 Books](https://airtable.com/shrugbQMDGVNvArMT/tblSrU1fNAykSMyXU)


## Images and Portraits:
- [Canvas Cards by Luke Patton](https://canvas-cards.glitch.me/)
- [Tiny](https://tixy.land/?code=1%2F%28%28x%5Ey%29%25t%29) Amazing javascript code golf
