Generative Art that is based on daily prompts for the month of January 2021. 

## Genuary 2021

Genuary 2021 was a collective project in which 100s of generative artists created art daily based on prompts that were given to them ahead of time

***** 
## Prompts

For this coding challenge, a group of generative artists got together and created a "prompt" for each day.
[Here](https://genuary2021.github.io/prompts) are the actual prompts.
