# Trapeze Balls in an endless loop

This was an early gif-loop attempt.

### Idea

I got this idea based on a very old juggling sequence. What if 20 (or 25) balls could loop endlessly on a square. From one edge to its adjacent side, it would "fly" (reminiscent of trapeze artists).

### Lesson
- It took 1680 frames for the 4 different colored balls to return to their starting position.
- When I switched to all white balls, I was done in 80 frames. Lesson learned!

### Resources
From these frames, I went to [EZ Gif](http://ezgif.com) and converted them into an animated gif.
