# Trapeze Balls in an endless loop

This was an early gif-loop attempt.

### Idea

I got this idea based on a very old juggling sequence. What if 20 (or 25) balls could loop endlessly on a square. From one edge to its adjacent side, it would "fly" (reminiscent of trapeze artists).

Think of the NEWS walls of a square. The balls all start from (say) the West wall going up. Then they fly to the South wall and move LEFT. Fly off to the East wall, where they move down. Once they hit the end point, they
fly to the North wall, and start traversing RIGHT. And from there, they fly back to the West wall, and start all over again.

### Lesson
- It took 1680 frames for the 4 different colored balls to return to their starting position.
- When I switched to all white balls, I was done in 80 frames. Lesson learned!

### Resources
From these frames, I went to [EZ Gif](http://ezgif.com) and converted them into an animated gif.
