### Color Collisions
Idea for Colliding Balls
balls cycle through a color spectrum endlessly.
[White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, White]. 

Rules: 
1. Each collision moves both Balls to their next color.
1. Do this on a Checkerboard background.
1. If a ball-center passes within epsilon of a square center, the square is painted the ball's color.
