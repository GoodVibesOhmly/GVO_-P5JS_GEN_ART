## Using Ball Animations

### Color Collisions
Idea for Colliding Balls
balls cycle through a color spectrum endlessly.
[White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, White]. 

Rules: 
1. Each collision moves both Balls to their next color.
1. Do this on a Checkerboard background.
1. If a ball-center passes within epsilon of a square center, the square is painted the ball's color.

## Using Perlin Noise

### Tree Rings
- Create "almost" concetric cirlces.
- using varying thickness (of lines/bands) and radii
- Use a tight color palette to convey year to year variation
- inner whorls for added impact
