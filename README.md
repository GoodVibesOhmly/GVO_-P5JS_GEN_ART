# Experiments in Generative Art
## Using Python and Processing

*Note: Several of these experiment use the Processing but in the Python Mode*

This is a repo to store several GenArt attempts. I use Python (Matplotlib) and Processing to create art sketches.

This is a meta-repo, in the sense that it is a directory of directorys. Each sub-directory in the repo has the `code` as well as a set of `images` in the images directory (where applicable). The README.md in each directory
explains what that particular experiment was about.

I try to make all my code available and runnable by others. There are many parameters that you can change and try to get your own results.

### Metro Maps [Code](/metro_maps) [images](metro_maps/images)

An experimental project that creates Metro Maps for imaginary cities.

What would the Metro (subway) map look like, for imaginary cities? Each time the code is run, it produces a
different set of Terminals, Routes, Junctions and Stations.

### Ball Animations [Code](/ball_animations) [images](ball_animations/images)

A series of sketches on balls colliding, as well as balls dodging each other, avoiding collisions.
