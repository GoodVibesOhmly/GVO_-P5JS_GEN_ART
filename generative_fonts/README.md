# Generative Fonts

`font.py` has the Class, with grid, size and several rules encoded. It can be a good starting point
for creating your own Fonts.

## Leafont - a Leaf-based font

This was the first generative font that I coded. Each leafletter is based on a leaf-shape. Eventually, I added some code to disallow duplicates.

TODO: Add Colors and Fills can make the Leafont alphabet grow.
