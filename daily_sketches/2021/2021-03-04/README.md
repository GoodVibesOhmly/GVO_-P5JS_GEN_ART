# DAILY SKETCH for 2021-03-04

## Done using P5.js

### Description

When possible I work for these `daily sketches` which are meant to be quick explorations     on whatever has me interested that day. This code is not typically optimized, but I share it as-is for anyone interested.

Idea: The basic unit is one circular sinusoidal shape. To make it interesting I did two things:
- 1. I varied the "amplitude" so that the 'waves' got progressively larger
- 2. I Rotated each shape by a small amount to get that echoing effect.
