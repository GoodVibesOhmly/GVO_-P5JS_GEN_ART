## 2021-11-04
Keywords: Bezier
 

## Description 

 Construct a bunch of Bezier curves, that emanate from the center. 
 Instead of plotting the base curve, draw a circle at each point of the bezier.
 Make the radius of each small circle to be dependent on the noise at that (x,y) coordinate, scaled.
 Render on a colored background
