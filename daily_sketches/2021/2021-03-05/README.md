# DAILY SKETCH for 2021-03-05

## Done using P5.js

### Description

When possible I work for these `daily sketches` which are meant to be quick explorations     on whatever has me interested that day. This code is not typically optimized, but I share it as-is     for anyone interested.

Multiple "Blooms" made of layers of scalloped circles.
