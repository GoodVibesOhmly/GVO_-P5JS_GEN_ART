# DAILY SKETCH for 2021-04-11

## Done using P5.js

### Description

These are my `daily sketches` which are meant to be quick explorations on whatever topic interests me on that day. Very often, you will see me attempting variations on the same theme for a few days in a row. On such occasions, the "published" daily sketch is still very much a work in progress.

This code is not typically optimized, but I share it as-is for anyone interested.
