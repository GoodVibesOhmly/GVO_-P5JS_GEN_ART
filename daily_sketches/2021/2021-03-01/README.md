# DAILY SKETCH for 2021-03-01

## Done using P5.js

### Description

When possible I work for these `daily sketches` which are meant to be quick explorations     on whatever has me interested that day. This code is not typically optimized, but I share it as-is     for anyone interested.

`Infinite Bounce`

I started with 12 particles and gave them random velocities. Each particle leaves a trail, and when it hits an invisible cirlce
(`rmax`) it bounces off. So all the partciles are forced to stay within the circle.
Unfortunately, the colors turned out to be way too dark.

Here are some of the images that were generated.

<img src = 'images/keep0.png' width = '300'> 
<img src = 'images/keep1.png' width = '300'> 
<img src = 'images/keep2.png' width = '300'> 
<img src = 'images/keep3.png' width = '300'> 
<img src = 'images/keep4.png' width = '300'>
