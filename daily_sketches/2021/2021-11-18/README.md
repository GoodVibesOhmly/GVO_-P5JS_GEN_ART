## 2021-11-18
Keywords: Background
 

## Description 

 10x10 layered Backgrounds inside panel boxes. Each box/panel has a slightly different background
 The idea is to use one of the corners and to draw colored shapes. 
 Just working on creating a set of usable Backgrounds, which I hope to use in future images
