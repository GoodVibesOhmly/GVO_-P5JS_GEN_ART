# DAILY SKETCH for 2021-03-06

## Done using P5.js

### Description

When possible I work for these `daily sketches` which are meant to be quick explorations     on whatever has me interested that day. This code is not typically optimized, but I share it as-is     for anyone interested.

[Code](2021-03-06) 

Here are some of the images that were generated.

<img src = 'images/keep0.png' width = '300'> 
<img src = 'images/keep_2021-3-7-11-53-33-35765.png' width = '300'> 
<img src = 'images/keep_2021-3-7-11-58-46-9765.png' width = '300'> 

Work in progress. A bunch of overlapping polygons. The convex hull is still not working right.
I will work on that tomorrow.
