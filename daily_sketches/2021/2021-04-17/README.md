## 2021-04-17
Keywords: Celtic pattern, Squares, Tiling
 

## Description 

 This is a classic Celtic pattern, based on overlapping squares. The appeal is that it
 sort of looks like they are all interconnected. I rewrote the code for yesterday's tiles,
 exploiting symmetry. And rotated the whole thing by 45 degrees.
