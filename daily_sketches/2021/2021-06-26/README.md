Keywords: Mandala, Concentric, Symmetry
 

## Description 

 A Mandala generating machine, that morphs slowly.
 One function (the director) to design the Mandala, and draw() just executes it.
 In each subsequent variation, ONE parameter only is altered, resulting
 in endless variations of Mandalas.
