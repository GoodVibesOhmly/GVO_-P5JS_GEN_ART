# Ideas for future daily sketches

A running of image ideas on what to try next here.

## 25 Squares Series
    Colors
    Filled
    Shapes
    Rotations
    Echo, Aztec
    Word squares with text
    text border
    Flow field squares
    Vertical lines...rotated squares
    Circles Only

## Images related...
    Pixel sorting
    pixel swapping

### Portrait based... 
    Triangulation on face edges... to create images
    Rasterize: Size of circles


## Single Line, mazelike
- Waclaw Szpakinski
  -   One long line all over the canvas, symmetrical
### Echo effects...lines that go parallel "around" fixed shapes


## Celtic Knots

## Tiling
- square tiles of ribbons that run curved and over and under one another. 4 symmetrical points wrt vertices

## Islamic Designs Series

## Cellular Automata
Cyclic : https://github.com/aschinchon/cyclic-cellular-automata/blob/main/cyclic.R
(Try this in P5.js)


## Map-making
    Islands, lakes, rives...

## Using Perlin Noise

### Tree Rings
- Create "almost" concetric cirlces.
- using varying thickness (of lines/bands) and radii
- Use a tight color palette to convey year to year variation
- inner whorls for added impact



## Text + Images Combining
 - Generative Calligraphy
 - Calligraphy strokes
    
## 30 Tutorials
1. 4-way, 6-way and 8-way symmetry
2. Perlin Noise: Mountain ranges.. lighter and darker as we go back
3. Noise dots: Connected by 2 lines
4. Sinusoidal curves
5. 15-puzzle
6. An Image made of images
7. Curved Circles, touching each other
8. random 90-Degree Rotations (Show before and after in final IG image)
9. Hexagonal Grid
10. Spiral Variations
11. Tiles and tessallation (Hexagon?)



-----
### 3 Hexagons Series
    Two hexagons sharing a center, and rotation, create a nice "gear tooth" effect. Use that somehow
    Move them around in many ways. A grid of them.
    all the same size, r and r/2 size
    flat and pointy topped
    endless variations
    
### Non-Overlapping Shapes
