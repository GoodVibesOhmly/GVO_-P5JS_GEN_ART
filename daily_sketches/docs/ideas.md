# Ideas for future daily sketches

I jot down ideas that I get about what to try next here.

### Islamic Designs Series

### Echo effects...lines that go parallel "around" fixed shapes
### Single line
    One long line all over the canvas, symmetrical

### Map-making
    Islands, lakes, rives...

### Images related...
    Pixel sorting
    pixel swapping
    Size of circles
    Triangulation on face edges... to create images

## Text + Images Combining

### 3 Hexagons Series
    Move them around in many ways. A grid of them.
    all the same size, r and r/2 size
    flat and pointy topped
    endless variations
    
### Non-Overlapping Shapes
