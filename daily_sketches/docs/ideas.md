# Ideas for future daily sketches

I jot down ideas that I get about what to try next here.

## Single Line, mazelike
- Waclaw Szpakinski
  -   One long line all over the canvas, symmetrical
### Echo effects...lines that go parallel "around" fixed shapes

### 10Print like == horiz, vert and diag

## Celtic Knots

## Islamic Designs Series


## Map-making
    Islands, lakes, rives...

## Images related...
    Pixel sorting
    pixel swapping
    Size of circles
    Triangulation on face edges... to create images

## Text + Images Combining

### 3 Hexagons Series
    Move them around in many ways. A grid of them.
    all the same size, r and r/2 size
    flat and pointy topped
    endless variations
    
### Non-Overlapping Shapes
