## Occasional Jottings related to the Daily Sketches


**2021-03-26**
The pace of progress and the amount of time I spend on coding here is not sustainable. So here's my current thinking:
I can relieve this pressure by going into one of 2 modes. In Mode 1, I will simply generate a "sketch of the day"
by tweaking parameters of any existing sketch. Most of my sketches have unexplored (in the grid-search sense) parameters anyway.
I could be tweaking just one sketch for weeks at a time. That is sustainable.
In Mode 2, (the creation mode) I will move at a more slow pace, building up my toolset or framework. These will eventually feed
Mode 1 sketches. I need to think more on these lines.

I know that I need to speed up. These sketches are taking up all of my 'free' time. So I need to see
where and how to gain efficiency?
- I am often too ambitious for each day.
- I want to switch ideas for sketches, move from series to series too quickly. that causes some delay.
- Have been wondering about the value of letting things 'lie low' and coming back to the same series again in a few days.
- One thing I noticed, as soon as I 'abandon' a series, I am flooded with new ideas of things I could have tried!
- What should I do on days when I have no time at all? One answer is to simply run a older sketch, vary parameters and get new results.
- I also need to focus more on what takes up most of my 'daily' time allotted for sketches. (Errors, new ideas, new Class structures)

These `non-overlapping blobs` are taking a lot longer than I expected.
But I am making progress daily. It was good to understand exactly how to use the vector cross-products idea
effectively. I am now able to get all the interior grid points of a shape clearly marked.

Yesterday, I came across Amy Dyer's sketchbooks(http://amydyer.art/wp/index.php/portfolio/category/sketchbooks/)
which was quite insipring. Not sure how to incorporate those into GenArt. But I know that I should be using my
iPad Pencil a lot more than I currently am.
