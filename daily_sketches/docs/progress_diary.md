## Occasional Jottings related to the Daily Sketches

*2021-03-12*
These `non-overlapping blobs` are taking a lot longer than I expected.
But I am making progress daily. It was good to understand exactly how to use the vector cross-products idea
effectively. I am now able to get all the interior grid points of a shape clearly marked.

Yesterday, I came across Amy Dyer's sketchbooks(http://amydyer.art/wp/index.php/portfolio/category/sketchbooks/)
which was quite insipring. Not sure how to incorporate those into GenArt. But I know that I should be using my
iPad Pencil a lot more than I currently am.
