# 10Print


## Variations

The code for these can be found in the links below the images.

### Arc-Print
Igor had this simple idea. Take 3/4 circles and orient them in one of 4 ways...

<img src = "images/arc_print.png" width = '300'>

[Code](arc_print.py)

### Swirly Rainbow
Julia Maiolo Created this nice effect. The Python implementation is by me. Use the source code, provided below.

This entire figure is made up of 3 different tiles:

<img src = "images/swirly_tile1.png" width = '100'>
<img src = "images/swirly_tile2.png" width = '100'>
<img src = "images/swirly_tile3.png" width = '100'>

and an optional variation: tile 3a:
<img src = "images/swirly_tile4.png" width = '100'>

to generate:

<img src = "images/swirly_rainbow.png" width = '300'>

[Code](swirly_rainbow.py)
